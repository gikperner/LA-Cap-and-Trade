# LA-Cap-and-Trade


## Background and Purpose
___
### `Background`

The state of California utilizes a cap-and-trade program to help reduce CO2 emissions across the state. Administered by the California Air Resources Board (ARB), yearly reports come out at two levels, the entity and facility level. Entities are the overarching organizations, such as Exxon-Mobile or the Los Angeles Department of Water, and have an Entity ID. Each entity is made up of a facility or multiple facilities and are assigned an ARBID. Information is provided yearly at facility levels but not yearly at an entity level.
### `Purpose`
The goal of the project is to:
  * Combine yearly reports into a single dataset
  * Link the data to coordinates from other dataset
  * Calculate total entity emissions for every year
  * Create a geopackage that combines new datasets and the Enviroscreen of LA County
